# Certification Data Sharing

The Certification Data Sharing rules allow providers to store and share FedRAMP Certification Data through the platform they choose as long as it follows FedRAMP rules for access, accuracy, and transparency. This helps customers and the public review consistent, current security and compliance information while recognizing that the information usually remains the provider's intellectual property and is not federal information.

    Providers MUST provide sufficient information in FedRAMP Certification Data to support agency authorization decisions but SHOULD NOT include sensitive information that would likely enable a threat actor to gain unauthorized access, cause harm, disrupt operations, or otherwise have a negative adverse impact on the cloud service offering.


    ---

        **Key Tests:**

        - Passwords, API keys, access credentials, etc.


        - Excessive detail about methodology that exposes weaknesses


        - Personally identifiable information about employees


        **Examples:**

        - DON'T: "In an emergency, an administrator with physical access to a system can log in using "secretadmin" with the password "pleasewutno""


        - DO: "In an emergency, administrators with physical access can log in directly."


        - DON'T: "All backup MFA credentials are stored in a SuperSafe Series 9000 safe in the CEOs office."


        - DO: "All backup MFA credentials are stored in a UL Class 350 safe in a secure location with limited access."
