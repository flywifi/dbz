# Certification Package Overview

The Certification Package Overview rules outline the expectations for a simple overview of the cloud service offering that must be included within a FedRAMP Certification Package. This overview replaces the historically required base System Security Plan for FedRAMP Rev5 and is intended to provide a clear, concise, and consistent summary of the offering and the information included in the package to help customers understand the offering at a high level.

### Certification Package Maintenance for Rev5

??? abstract "CPO-CSF-CPM"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    === "Class A"
        Providers with Rev5 Class A Certifications SHOULD persistently maintain their FedRAMP Certification Package to ensure it is up to date and complete at least once every year.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year

    === "Class B"
        Providers with Rev5 Class B Certifications MUST persistently maintain their FedRAMP Certification Package to ensure it is up to date and complete at least once every year.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year

    === "Class C"
        Providers with Rev5 Class C Certifications MUST persistently maintain their FedRAMP Certification Package to ensure it is up to date and complete at least once every year.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year

    === "Class D"
        Providers with Rev5 Class D Certifications MUST persistently maintain their FedRAMP Certification Package to ensure it is up to date and complete at least once every six months.

        **Timeframe:** 6 months


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _This maximum timeframe for Rev5 is the absolutely poorest worst case for horrible customer experience and is based on legacy FedRAMP Rev5 allowing providers to leave their packages unmaintained for up to a year. Rev5 providers should maintain their packages far more frequently than this requirement to ensure potential customers have access to up-to-date information, updating it at least after every transformative significant change._
    - _FedRAMP 20x Certifications expect providers to maintain their FedRAMP Certification Packages as changes occur to ensure they are never out of date._
