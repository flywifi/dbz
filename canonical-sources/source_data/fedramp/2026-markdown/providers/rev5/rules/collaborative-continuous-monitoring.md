# Collaborative Continuous Monitoring

The Collaborative Continuous Monitoring rules help agencies use shared, current authorization information from providers as part of each agency's own Information Security Continuous Monitoring strategy. These rules reduce unnecessary manual burden by encouraging automated monitoring and review while allowing each agency to make its own risk-based decisions about ongoing authorization.

**Subsets**

- [Quarterly Reviews](#quarterly-reviews)

    _**Note:** This could be email by default but providers are encouraged to consider something more interactive as appropriate._

### Anonymized Feedback Summary

??? abstract "CCM-OCR-AFS"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST supply an anonymized and desensitized summary of the feedback, questions, and answers about each Ongoing Certification Report as an addendum to the Ongoing Certification Report OR in the next Ongoing Certification Report.


    ---

    _**Note:** This is intended to encourage sharing of information and decrease the burden on the cloud service provider - providing this summary will reduce duplicate questions from agencies and ensure FedRAMP has access to this information. It is generally in the provider's interest to update this addendum frequently throughout the quarter._

### Spread Out Reports

??? abstract "CCM-OCR-SOR"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers SHOULD establish a regular 3 month cycle for Ongoing Certification Reports that is spread out from the beginning, middle, or end of each quarter.


    ---

    _**Note:** This recommendation is intended to discourage hundreds of cloud service providers from releasing their Ongoing Certification Reports during the first or last week of each quarter because that is the easiest way for a single provider to track this deliverable; the result would overwhelm agencies with many cloud services. Widely used cloud service providers are encouraged to work with their customers to identify ideal timeframes for this cycle._
