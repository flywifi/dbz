### FedRAMP Ready Conversion

??? abstract "FRC-CSF-RDY"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers with FedRAMP Rev5 Ready status MUST convert to a FedRAMP Certification by whichever of the follow dates is later: the expiration of their annual assessment or November 17, 2026 (the legacy FedRAMP Ready status will be entirely removed on December 31, 2027).


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _The simplest conversion in most cases would be to a FedRAMP 20x Class A Certification._
    - _Cloud services that do not wish to convert or do not meet conversion criteria will be renamed Legacy FedRAMP Ready and otherwise retired from FedRAMP Ready._
