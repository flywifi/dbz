    Providers MUST NOT seek both FedRAMP Rev5 Program Certification and FedRAMP 20x Program Certification for the same cloud service offering; pick one type.


    ---

    _**Note:** This rule does not prevent a provider from seeking and maintaining a FedRAMP Rev5 Agency Certification and a FedRAMP 20x Program Certification for the same cloud service offering, however, doing so is strongly discouraged due to the increased complexity and risk of confusion for all parties._

    _**Notes:**_

    - _Some of these specific FedRAMP rules may not have similar counterparts in external frameworks and providers will need to implement new processes to follow these rules._
    - _In general, for each of these FedRAMP requirements, providers should include a sufficiently detailed summary that reviewers will not need to dig into the related security framework materials to understand the related decisions - just saying "see SOC 2 report" is not particularly helpful._
    - _Information about how the provider addresses the included Key Security Indicators are required for both Rev5 and 20x Class A Certifications._
