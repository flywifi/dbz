## Mandatory Class A Rules: Addressing FedRAMP Communication (AFC) {#mandatory-class-a-rules-addressing-fedramp-communication-afc}

The Addressing FedRAMP Communication rules (formerly FedRAMP Security Inbox) ensure FedRAMP can reliably contact the security and compliance staff responsible for every FedRAMP-authorized cloud service offering. These rules also set expectations for urgent communications, response time testing, and routing important messages separately from general support or customer service channels.

### Complete Required Actions

??? abstract "AFC-CSO-CRA"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST complete the required actions in Emergency or Emergency Test designated messages sent by FedRAMP within the timeframe included in the message.


    ---

    _**Note:** Timeframes may vary by FedRAMP Certification class._

    **Terms:** [Certification Class](../../../definitions/#certification-class){ data-preview }
### Maintain a FedRAMP Security Inbox

??? abstract "AFC-CSO-INB"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST establish and maintain an email address to receive messages from FedRAMP; this inbox is a FedRAMP Security Inbox (FSI).

    ---

    !!! danger "Be careful using a personal email tied to an individual for this inbox due to the significant risk to future communications after a change in personnel!"

    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _Unless otherwise notified, FedRAMP will use the listed Security Email on the Marketplace for these notifications._
    - _If a provider establishes a new inbox in reaction to this guidance that is different from the Security Email then they must follow the [AFC-CSO-NOC (Notification of Changes)](../../../providers/20x/rules/addressing-fedramp-communication.md#notification-of-changes){ data-preview } rules to notify FedRAMP._

## Mandatory Class A Rules: Minimum Assessment Scope (MAS) {#mandatory-class-a-rules-minimum-assessment-scope-mas}

The Minimum Assessment Scope rules help providers define assessment boundaries narrowly enough to avoid unnecessary review of components that do not affect the offering's security. These rules still ensure the assessment includes the resources and connections needed to understand the offering's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Identify Information Resources

??? abstract "MAS-CSO-IIR"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST identify a set of information resources to assess for FedRAMP Certification that includes all information resources that are likely to handle federal customer data or likely to impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of federal customer data handled by the cloud service offering; this set of information resources is the cloud service offering.


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _Certain categories of cloud computing products and services are specified as entirely outside the scope of FedRAMP by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. All such products and services are therefore not included in the cloud service offering for FedRAMP. For more, see https://fedramp.gov/scope._
    - _Software produced by cloud service providers that is delivered separately for installation on agency systems and not operated in a shared responsibility model (typically including agents, application clients, mobile applications, etc. that are not fully managed by the cloud service provider) is not a cloud computing product or service and is entirely outside the scope of FedRAMP under the FedRAMP Certification Act. All such software is therefore not included in the cloud service offering for FedRAMP. For more, see https://fedramp.gov/scope._
    - _All aspects of the cloud service offering are determined and maintained by the cloud service provider in accordance with related FedRAMP Certification rules and documented by the cloud service provider in their FedRAMP Certification Package._

## Mandatory Class A Rules: Vulnerability Detection and Response (VDR) {#mandatory-class-a-rules-vulnerability-detection-and-response-vdr}

The Vulnerability Detection and Response rules require providers to continuously identify, analyze, prioritize, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities and related exposures through automated systems. These rules give providers flexibility in implementation while ensuring agencies receive the information needed to support ongoing authorization decisions.

### Vulnerability Detection

??? abstract "VDR-CSO-DET"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST systematically, persistently, and promptly discover and identify vulnerabilities within their cloud service offering using appropriate techniques such as assessment, scanning, threat intelligence, vulnerability disclosure mechanisms, bug bounties, penetration testing, incident response, automated control testing, supply chain monitoring, and other relevant capabilities; this process is called vulnerability detection. Vulnerability detection includes persistently verifying and validating that information resources and processes are operating as intended and documented for FedRAMP Practices.

    ---

    !!! danger "Vulnerability Detection and Response includes all efforts to identify weaknesses in a system and is NOT limited to traditional vulnerability scanning or testing. An out-of-date control statement in the Security Decision Record is a vulnerability that must be detected and remediated just like any other vulnerability."

    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _FedRAMP's vulnerability detection (and response) rules are intended to set modern expectations for maintaining the security of a cloud service. Historical FedRAMP guidance on vulnerability scanning or continuous monitoring generally focused only on CVE-type vulnerabilities while leaving other types of vulnerabilities and exposures unaddressed._
    - _Providers are encouraged to leverage their existing holistic security review, architecture review, and similar processes to meet these requirements. FedRAMP strongly discourages providers from implementing separate vulnerability detection and response processes for FedRAMP reporting that are operated by independent compliance branches unless these processes are consuming data directly from the areas of the cloud service that actively maintain it._

## Recommended Class A Rules: Certification Data Sharing (CDS) {#recommended-class-a-rules-certification-data-sharing-cds}

The Certification Data Sharing rules allow providers to store and share FedRAMP Certification Data through the platform they choose as long as it follows FedRAMP rules for access, accuracy, and transparency. This helps customers and the public review consistent, current security and compliance information while recognizing that the information usually remains the provider's intellectual property and is not federal information.

### Availability Reporting

??? abstract "CDS-CSO-AVR"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    === "Class A"
        Providers with Class A Certifications SHOULD maintain a web service, available to all necessary parties, that indicates current and historical availability of core services within the cloud service offering over at least the past 30 days, including availability incidents, in both human-readable and machine-readable formats; this service SHOULD be available even if the primary cloud service offering is unavailable.

        ---

        _**Note:** This service may be separate from the trust center._

## Recommended Class A Rules: Certification Package Overview (CPO) {#recommended-class-a-rules-certification-package-overview-cpo}

The Certification Package Overview rules outline the expectations for a simple overview of the cloud service offering that must be included within a FedRAMP Certification Package. This overview replaces the historically required base System Security Plan for FedRAMP Rev5 and is intended to provide a clear, concise, and consistent summary of the offering and the information included in the package to help customers understand the offering at a high level.

### Certification Package Maintenance for Rev5

??? abstract "CPO-CSF-CPM"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    === "Class A"
        Providers with Rev5 Class A Certifications SHOULD persistently maintain their FedRAMP Certification Package to ensure it is up to date and complete at least once every year.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _This maximum timeframe for Rev5 is the absolutely poorest worst case for horrible customer experience and is based on legacy FedRAMP Rev5 allowing providers to leave their packages unmaintained for up to a year. Rev5 providers should maintain their packages far more frequently than this requirement to ensure potential customers have access to up-to-date information, updating it at least after every transformative significant change._
    - _FedRAMP 20x Certifications expect providers to maintain their FedRAMP Certification Packages as changes occur to ensure they are never out of date._

## Optional Class A Rules: Certification Data Sharing (CDS) {#optional-class-a-rules-certification-data-sharing-cds}

The Certification Data Sharing rules allow providers to store and share FedRAMP Certification Data through the platform they choose as long as it follows FedRAMP rules for access, accuracy, and transparency. This helps customers and the public review consistent, current security and compliance information while recognizing that the information usually remains the provider's intellectual property and is not federal information.

### Per-Service Certification Materials

    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    === "Class A"
        Providers with Class A Certifications MAY supply per-service FedRAMP Certification materials.


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _Providers determine what they consider to be separate services, based on maximizing the customer experience for agencies who may only adopt some services and not others._
    - _Providers are encouraged to provide a single comprehensive set of materials for all shared aspects of the service offering and only provide separate materials for unique aspects of each service to minimize the burden on providers and agencies._
## Optional Class A Rules: Collaborative Continuous Monitoring (CCM) {#optional-class-a-rules-collaborative-continuous-monitoring-ccm}

The Collaborative Continuous Monitoring rules help agencies use shared, current authorization information from providers as part of each agency's own Information Security Continuous Monitoring strategy. These rules reduce unnecessary manual burden by encouraging automated monitoring and review while allowing each agency to make its own risk-based decisions about ongoing authorization.

### Quarterly Review Meeting

!!! quote ""
    === "Class A"
        Providers with Class A Certifications MAY persistently complete an independent verification and validation assessment of all applicable FedRAMP rules with a FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment service OR FedRAMP at least once per year; this is a FedRAMP independent assessment.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _The first such completed assessment is typically called an "initial assessment" while following assessments are called "annual assessments."_
    - _The specific requirements for independent verification and validation assessments are documented by the FedRAMP Certification Class and Type._
    - _The option for assessment by FedRAMP directly is limited to cloud services that are explicitly prioritized by FedRAMP, in consultation with the FedRAMP Board and the federal Chief Information Officers Council; this is _extremely_ rare._
    - _FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment services are listed on the FedRAMP Marketplace._
