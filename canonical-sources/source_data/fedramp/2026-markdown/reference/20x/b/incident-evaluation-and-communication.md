# Incident Evaluation and Communication

The Incident Evaluation and Communication rules explain how providers must communicate incident information to FedRAMP and government customers when they are affected by an incident or likely to be affected by an incident.

**Subsets**

- [FedRAMP Responsibilities](#fedramp-responsibilities)
- [General Provider Responsibilities](#general-provider-responsibilities)

!!! info "Effective Date(s) & Overall Applicability for 20x"
    - **Required** (Consolidated Rules for 2026)
    - **Optional Adoption:** 2026-07-04
    - **Obtain:** 2026-07-04
    - **Maintain:** 2027-01-01
    - **Grace Ends:** On the first FedRAMP independent assessment started after 2027-01-01


## Activity Workflow: Incident Evaluation and Communication

This workflow illustrates the process for evaluating incidents and persistently notifying all affected parties during the incident if it is a FedRAMP Reportable Incident.

### Ongoing Review

??? abstract "IEC-FRP-ORV"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-07-02:** Update terminology from "Response" to "Communication" in FedRAMP Incident Evaluation rules.


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    FedRAMP MUST periodically review FedRAMP Incident Evaluation and Communication implementation with providers based on lack of reporting or other information.

    !!! warning "Corrective Actions"
        - FedRAMP will request a Corrective Action Plan when a provider is unaware of the rules or has failed to implement proper procedures.
        - FedRAMP will grant a 3 month grace period to implement proper procedures pending remediation and possible revocation of FedRAMP Certification.
