!!! quote ""
    Providers seeking a Certification MUST supply a complete FedRAMP Certification Package to FedRAMP for initial certification; the FedRAMP Certification Package MUST include at least the following information:

    1. A Certification Package Overview
    1. A Security Decision Record
    1. A real or example Ongoing Certification Report following [CCM-OCR-AVL (Report Availability)](collaborative-continuous-monitoring.md#report-availability){ data-preview }

??? abstract "FRC-CSO-JSN"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST supply machine-readable information in JSON documents that are valid against the corresponding JSON schema when a rule contains a FedRAMP JSON schema, UNLESS otherwise specified in the rule.


    ---

    _**Note:** FedRAMP JSON schemas are designed to be lightweight and flexible to establish a minimum set of structured information while allowing providers to improve on the format and structure of the information as needed to meet their needs and the needs of their customers._

    ---
    **Terms:** [Machine-Readable](../../../definitions/#machine-readable){ data-preview }
### Maintain Responsibility and Accountability

??? abstract "FRC-CSO-MRA"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST maintain responsibility and accountability for the accuracy and completeness of all information in the FedRAMP Certification Package, especially when they engage a third party (such as an independent assessor, advisory service, or external tools) to supply information on their behalf.

### Pick One Program Certification Type

??? abstract "FRC-CSO-POP"
    **Changelog:**

!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST NOT seek both FedRAMP Rev5 Program Certification and FedRAMP 20x Program Certification for the same cloud service offering; pick one type.


    ---

    _**Note:** This rule does not prevent a provider from seeking and maintaining a FedRAMP Rev5 Agency Certification and a FedRAMP 20x Program Certification for the same cloud service offering, however, doing so is strongly discouraged due to the increased complexity and risk of confusion for all parties._

    **Terms:** [Cloud Service Offering](../../../definitions/#cloud-service-offering){ data-preview }
## Applying for FedRAMP Certification {#applying-for-fedramp-certification}

These rules apply to cloud service providers who have met all other relevant rules and are ready to apply for any FedRAMP Certification.

### Applying for FedRAMP Certification

??? abstract "FRC-APP-AFC"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.


!!! warning "This FRR includes a notification requirement!"
    - Notify FedRAMP via form: [\[For CSPs\] FedRAMP Certification Application Form](https://help.fedramp.gov/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=51137131584283).

    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST supply a fresh initial FedRAMP Certification Package that shows the current status of the cloud service offering as verified and validated by the provider within the previous 7 days.


    ---
    **Terms:** [Certification Package](../../../definitions/#certification-package){ data-preview }, [Cloud Service Offering](../../../definitions/#cloud-service-offering){ data-preview }, [Validation](../../../definitions/#validation){ data-preview }, [Verification](../../../definitions/#verification){ data-preview }
### Fresh Independent Assessment

    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    === "Class C"

!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST NOT use a third party to apply for a FedRAMP Certification on their behalf; this includes independent assessment services.


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _FedRAMP previously allowed independent assessment services to submit applications on behalf of providers, but this caused confusion about who was responsible for the application and the information in it. Providers should apply directly to ensure clear accountability._
    - _Providers may use third parties to help them prepare their application and assessment materials for submission._
