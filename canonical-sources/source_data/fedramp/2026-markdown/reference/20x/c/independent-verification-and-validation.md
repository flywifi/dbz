### FedRAMP Independent Assessments

??? abstract "IVV-CSO-FIA"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    === "Class C"
        Providers with Class C Certifications MUST persistently complete an independent verification and validation assessment of all applicable FedRAMP rules with a FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment service OR FedRAMP at least once per year; this is a FedRAMP independent assessment.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _The first such completed assessment is typically called an "initial assessment" while following assessments are called "annual assessments."_
    - _The specific requirements for independent verification and validation assessments are documented by the FedRAMP Certification Class and Type._
    - _The option for assessment by FedRAMP directly is limited to cloud services that are explicitly prioritized by FedRAMP, in consultation with the FedRAMP Board and the federal Chief Information Officers Council; this is _extremely_ rare._
    - _FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment services are listed on the FedRAMP Marketplace._

!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST supply evidence to all necessary assessors of the implementation of the measures that have been documented to meet FedRAMP Practices; this evidence is the result of verification.


    ---

    _**Note:** For example, if the documentation says that firewall rules are used to block traffic then the cloud service provider would verify that firewall rules are in place to block traffic and supply that evidence to assessors (preferably by allowing them to see how firewall configurations are deployed from a source of truth)._

    Providers MUST supply evidence to all necessary assessors of the effectiveness of the measures that have been implemented to meet FedRAMP Practices; this evidence is the result of validation.


    ---

    _**Note:** For example, after verifying that firewalls are configured to block traffic following [IVV-CSO-SEI (Supply Evidence of Implementation)](#supply-evidence-of-implementation){ data-preview }, the provider would validate that traffic is actually being blocked and supply evidence of that validation to assessors (such as by allowing them to see metrics on the traffic that is blocked vs not)._
