    ---

    _**Note:** This rule does not prevent a provider from seeking and maintaining a FedRAMP Rev5 Agency Certification and a FedRAMP 20x Program Certification for the same cloud service offering, however, doing so is strongly discouraged due to the increased complexity and risk of confusion for all parties._

    _**Notes:**_

    - _Some of these specific FedRAMP rules may not have similar counterparts in external frameworks and providers will need to implement new processes to follow these rules._
    - _In general, for each of these FedRAMP requirements, providers should include a sufficiently detailed summary that reviewers will not need to dig into the related security framework materials to understand the related decisions - just saying "see SOC 2 report" is not particularly helpful._
    - _Information about how the provider addresses the included Key Security Indicators are required for both Rev5 and 20x Class A Certifications._

### FedRAMP Ready Conversion

??? abstract "FRC-CSF-RDY"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers with FedRAMP Rev5 Ready status MUST convert to a FedRAMP Certification by whichever of the follow dates is later: the expiration of their annual assessment or November 17, 2026 (the legacy FedRAMP Ready status will be entirely removed on December 31, 2027).


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _The simplest conversion in most cases would be to a FedRAMP 20x Class A Certification._
    - _Cloud services that do not wish to convert or do not meet conversion criteria will be renamed Legacy FedRAMP Ready and otherwise retired from FedRAMP Ready._
