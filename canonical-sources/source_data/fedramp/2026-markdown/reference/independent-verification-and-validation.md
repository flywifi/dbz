### FedRAMP Independent Assessments

??? abstract "IVV-CSO-FIA"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    === "Class A"
        Providers with Class A Certifications MAY persistently complete an independent verification and validation assessment of all applicable FedRAMP rules with a FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment service OR FedRAMP at least once per year; this is a FedRAMP independent assessment.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year

    === "Class B"
        Providers with Class B Certifications MUST persistently complete an independent verification and validation assessment of all applicable FedRAMP rules with a FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment service OR FedRAMP at least once per year; this is a FedRAMP independent assessment.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year

    === "Class C"
        Providers with Class C Certifications MUST persistently complete an independent verification and validation assessment of all applicable FedRAMP rules with a FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment service OR FedRAMP at least once per year; this is a FedRAMP independent assessment.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year

    === "Class D"
        Providers with Class D Certifications MUST persistently complete an independent verification and validation assessment of all applicable FedRAMP rules with a FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment service OR FedRAMP at least once per year; this is a FedRAMP independent assessment.

        **Timeframe:** 1 year


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _The first such completed assessment is typically called an "initial assessment" while following assessments are called "annual assessments."_
    - _The specific requirements for independent verification and validation assessments are documented by the FedRAMP Certification Class and Type._
    - _The option for assessment by FedRAMP directly is limited to cloud services that are explicitly prioritized by FedRAMP, in consultation with the FedRAMP Board and the federal Chief Information Officers Council; this is _extremely_ rare._
    - _FedRAMP Recognized independent assessment services are listed on the FedRAMP Marketplace._

### Mandatory Control Assessment

??? abstract "IVV-CSF-MCA"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST have all applicable Rev5 Controls included in FedRAMP independent assessments every 3 years but are not required to have all Rev5 Controls included in the same FedRAMP independent assessment.


    ---

    _**Note:** Traditionally this has been done by reviewing a rotating selection of Rev5 Controls at each annual assessment, however this requirement is a ceiling and not a floor. See [IVV-CSF-PCA (Preferred Control Assessment)](#preferred-control-assessment){ data-preview } for FedRAMP's recommended approach to Rev5 control assessments._
