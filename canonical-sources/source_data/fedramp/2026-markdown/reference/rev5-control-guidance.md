        The interrelated controls of AC-20, CA-3, and SA-9 should be differentiated as follows:

        AC-20 describes system access to and from external systems.

        CA-3 describes documentation of an agreement between the respective system owners when data is exchanged between the CSO and an external system.

        SA-9 describes the responsibilities of external system owners. These responsibilities would typically be captured in the agreement required by CA-3.
