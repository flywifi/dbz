    Providers MUST supply machine-readable information in JSON documents that are valid against the corresponding JSON schema when a rule contains a FedRAMP JSON schema, UNLESS otherwise specified in the rule.

    Providers MUST NOT seek both FedRAMP Rev5 Program Certification and FedRAMP 20x Program Certification for the same cloud service offering; pick one type.


    ---

    _**Note:** This rule does not prevent a provider from seeking and maintaining a FedRAMP Rev5 Agency Certification and a FedRAMP 20x Program Certification for the same cloud service offering, however, doing so is strongly discouraged due to the increased complexity and risk of confusion for all parties._

    _**Notes:**_

    - _FedRAMP previously allowed independent assessment services to submit applications on behalf of providers, but this caused confusion about who was responsible for the application and the information in it. Providers should apply directly to ensure clear accountability._
    - _Providers may use third parties to help them prepare their application and assessment materials for submission._

### FedRAMP Ready Conversion

??? abstract "FRC-CSF-RDY"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers with FedRAMP Rev5 Ready status MUST convert to a FedRAMP Certification by whichever of the follow dates is later: the expiration of their annual assessment or November 17, 2026 (the legacy FedRAMP Ready status will be entirely removed on December 31, 2027).


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _The simplest conversion in most cases would be to a FedRAMP 20x Class A Certification._
    - _Cloud services that do not wish to convert or do not meet conversion criteria will be renamed Legacy FedRAMP Ready and otherwise retired from FedRAMP Ready._
