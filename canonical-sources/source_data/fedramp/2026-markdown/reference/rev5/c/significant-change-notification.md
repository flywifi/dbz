# Significant Change Notification

The Significant Change Notification rules supply a simple framework allowing providers to make significant changes to their own products while keeping agency customers in the loop. These rules organize significant changes into clear categories so agencies can understand the expected risk and make authorization decisions accordingly.

**Subsets**

- [FedRAMP Responsibilities](#fedramp-responsibilities)
- [General Provider Responsibilities](#general-provider-responsibilities)
- [Adaptive Changes](#adaptive-changes)
- [Routine Recurring Changes](#routine-recurring-changes)
- [Transformative Changes](#transformative-changes)

    Providers MUST evaluate all potential significant changes to determine the type of significant change and follow the appropriate Significant Change Notification rules.

    1. Is it a significant change? --> Continue evaluation and follow the Significant Change Notification rules.
    1. If it is, is it an FedRAMP Certification class change?  --> This requires a new assessment and cannot be done under the Significant Change Notification rules.
    1. If it is not, is it a routine recurring change? --> Follow the Routine Recurring Change rules (SCN-RTR Routine Recurring Changes).
    1. If it is not, is it a transformative change? --> Follow the Transformative Change rules (SCN-TRF Transformative Changes).
    1. If it is not, then it is an adaptive change --> Follow the Adaptive Change rules (SCN-ADP Adaptive Changes).

### Notification Requirements

??? abstract "SCN-ADP-NTF"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.


!!! warning "This FRR includes a notification requirement!"
    - Notify All Necessary Parties via an update: FedRAMP Certification Data.


!!! quote ""
    Providers MUST notify all necessary parties within 10 business days after finishing adaptive changes, also including the following information:

    **Timeframe:** 10 business days

    1. Summary of any new risks identified and/or vulnerabilities resulting from the change (if applicable)


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _Activities that match the adaptive significant change type are a frequent and normal part of iteratively improving a service by deploying new functionality or modifying existing functionality in a way that is typically transparent to customers and does not introduce significant new security risks._
    - _In general, most changes that do not happen regularly will be adaptive changes. This change type deliberately covers a wide range of activities in a way that requires assessment and consideration._

    ??? tip "Tips on adaptive changes"

        **Key Tests:**

        - Requires minimal changes to security plans or procedures


        - Requires some careful planning and project management to implement, but does not rise to the level of planning required for transformative changes


        - Requires verification of existing functionality and secure configuration after implementation


        **Examples:**

        - Updates to operating systems, containers, virtual machines, software or libraries with known breaking changes, complex steps, or service disruption


        - Deploying larger than normal incremental feature improvements in code or libraries that are the work of multiple weeks of development efforts but are not considered a major new service


        - Changing cryptographic modules where the new module meets the same standards and characteristics of the former


        - Replacing a like-for-like component where some security plan or procedure adjustments are required (e.g., scanning tool or managed database swap)


        - Adding models to existing approved AI services without exposing federal customer data to new services

## Routine Recurring Changes {#routine-recurring-changes}

These rules apply to all routine recurring significant changes.

### No Notification Requirements

??? abstract "SCN-RTR-NNR"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers SHOULD NOT make formal Significant Change Notifications for routine recurring changes; this type of change is exempted from notification requirements.


    ---

    _**Notes:**_

    - _Activities that match the routine recurring significant change type are performed regularly and routinely by cloud service providers to address flaws or vulnerabilities, address incidents, and generally perform the typical maintenance and service delivery changes expected during day-to-day operations._
    - _These changes leverage mature processes and capabilities to identify, mitigate, and remediate risks as part of the change. They are often entirely automated and may occur without human intervention, even though they have an impact on security of the service._
    - _If the activity does not occur regularly and routinely then it cannot be a significant change of this type (e.g., replacing all physical firewalls to remediate a vulnerability is obviously not regular or routine)._

    ??? tip "Tips on ongoing operations"

        **Key Tests:**

        - Routine care and feeding by staff during normal duties


        - No major impact to service availability


        - Does not require executive approval


        **Examples:**

        - Provisioning or deprovisioning capacity to support service elasticity


        - Changing or tuning performance configurations for instances or services


        - Updating and maintaining operational handling of information flows and protection across physical and logical networks (e.g., updating firewall rules)


        - Generating or refreshing API or access tokens



    ??? tip "Tips on vulnerability management"

        **Key Tests:**

        - Minor, incremental patching or updates


        - Significant refactoring or migration process NOT required


        - No breaking changes


        **Examples:**

        - Updating security service or endpoint signatures


        - Routine patching of devices, operating systems, software or libraries


        - Updating and deploying code that applies normal fixes and improvements as part of a regular development cycle


        - Vulnerability remediation activity that simply replaces a known-bad component(s) with a better version of the exact same thing, running in the exact same way with no changes to processes

### Third-Party Review

??? abstract "SCN-TRF-TPR"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    Providers SHOULD engage a third-party assessor to review the scope and impact of the planned change before starting transformative changes if human validation is necessary; such reviews SHOULD be limited to security decisions that require human validation.


    ---

    _**Note:** Activities that match the transformative significant change type are rare for a cloud service offering, adjusted for the size, scale, and complexity of the service. Small cloud service offerings may go years without transformative changes, while hyperscale providers may release multiple transformative changes per year._


    ??? tip "Tips on transformative changes"

        **Key Tests:**

        - Alters the service risk profile or require new or significantly different actions to address customer responsibilities


        - Requires significant new design, development and testing with discrete associated project planning, budget, marketing, etc.


        - Requires extensive updates to security assessments, documentation, and how a large number of security requirements are met and validated


        **Examples:**

        - The addition, removal, or replacement of a critical third party service that handles a significant portion of information (e.g., IaaS change)


        - Increasing the security categorization of a service within the offering that actively handles federal customer data (does NOT include impact change of entire offering - see FedRAMP Certification class change)


        - Replacement of underlying management planes or paradigm shift in workload orchestration (e.g., bare-metal servers or virtual machines to containers, migration to kubernetes)


        - Datacenter migration where large amounts of federal customer data is moved across boundaries different from normal day-to-day operations


        - Adding a new AI-based capability that impacts federal customer data in a different way than existing services or capabilities (such as integrating a new third-party service or training on federal customer data)
