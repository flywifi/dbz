# Addressing FedRAMP Communication

The Addressing FedRAMP Communication rules (formerly FedRAMP Security Inbox) ensure FedRAMP can reliably contact the security and compliance staff responsible for every FedRAMP-authorized cloud service offering. These rules also set expectations for urgent communications, response time testing, and routing important messages separately from general support or customer service channels.

### Verified Emails

??? abstract "AFC-FRP-VRE"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    FedRAMP MUST send messages to cloud service providers using an official @fedramp.gov or @gsa.gov email address with properly configured Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) email authentication.


    ---

    _**Note:** Anyone at GSA can send email from @fedramp.gov or @gsa.gov - FedRAMP team members will typically have "FedRAMP" or "F20B" in their name but this is not universal or enforceable. The nature of government enterprise IT services makes it difficult for FedRAMP to isolate FedRAMP-specific team members with enforceable identifiers._

### Criticality Designators

??? abstract "AFC-FRP-CDS"
    **Changelog:**


    - **2026-06-24:** Official launch of the FedRAMP Consolidated Rules for 2026.




!!! quote ""
    FedRAMP MUST convey the criticality of the message in the subject line, IF the message requires an elevated reaction, using one of the following designators:

    1. **Emergency:** There is a potential incident or crisis such that FedRAMP requires an extremely urgent reaction; emergency messages will contain aggressive timeframes for reaction and failure to meet these timeframes will result in corrective action.
    1. **Emergency Test:** FedRAMP requires an extremely urgent reaction to confirm the functionality and effectiveness of the FedRAMP Security Inbox; emergency test messages will contain aggressive timeframes for reaction and failure to meet these timeframes will result in corrective action.
    1. **Important:** There is an important issue that FedRAMP requires the cloud service provider to address; important messages will contain reasonable timeframes for reaction and failure to meet these timeframes may result in corrective action.


    ---

    _**Note:** Messages sent by FedRAMP without one of these designators are considered general communications and do not require an elevated reaction; these may be resolved in the normal course of business by the cloud service provider._

    _**Note:** FedRAMP Class D Certified cloud service providers are expected to address Emergency messages (including tests) from FedRAMP with a reaction time appropriate to operating a service where failure to react rapidly might have a severe or debilitating customer effect on the U.S. Government; some Emergency messages may require faster reaction and all such messages should be addressed as quickly as possible._
